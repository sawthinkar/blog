## History of blogging 
I somehow came across this [YouTube video][5] from ColdFusion and found out the very first blog on the internet, [Justin's Home Page][6].

## Why am I making a list of blogs here? 
I don't remember exactly where I read this from. Maybe, Twitter. They say, there was a time back when the internet first appeared and people were proud to have their own little blog. 

So what happened now? Everyone seems gradually sucked into the platforms like Facebook. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is also one of the main reasons I ended using Facebook and its other products. (I reactivated my Facebook account on August 3rd, 2019, which had been deactivated back in June 2018, to get in touch with friends again. So for me Facebook is more like a contact book.) (I just decided to be back and fully active on Facebook and Instagram on September 20, 2020 after a friend shared me [Don't quit Facebook. Change laws.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/technology/quit-facebook-campaign.html)). I was frustrated when I couldn't deactivate my account instantly and realized I barely own all my info posted on Facebook. Another reason is to [minimize dopamine hits][10] made from notification, likes, shares and instant chats. Starting from the second week of January 2019, I have also been trying to use the [grayscaled screen][9] on my phone more often. 

Here are the some useful setting options.

What I believe is that one day, to a certain extent, people will have their own profile and personal timeline. And there will be a certain decentralized platform, which will just redirect to the personal sites or scrapes the public content from those personal sites instead of storing all the users' data and personal information. And I think [Brave browser][7] is taking an initial step with that and [Basic Attention Token][8] will be common among bloggers and readers. 

I also have $BAT setup for this blog, and if you ever feel like supporting me, here is the [referral link][11] to download Brave. 

#### Some quotes from Aaron  
"On the internet, everyone can get a channel; 
everyone can get a blog or a MySpace page; 
everyone has a way of expressing themselves and so what you see now is not a question of who gets access to the airwaves. It's a question of who gets control over the way you find people."  
"You start seeing power centralizing in sites like Google, these sort of 'gatekeepers' that tell you where on the internet you want to go, the people who provide you your sources of news and information."
