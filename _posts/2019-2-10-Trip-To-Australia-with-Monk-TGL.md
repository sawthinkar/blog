## Trip to Australia with Monk TGL 10 - 24  

I really want to write about my recent trip to Melbourne. The Karen community. Refugees. Revolutionists. Civil war. Life abroad. Life back home. Karen language. Youth. Peace. Developed country and developing country. Strength. Unity. Culture. Religion. Human nature. Kindness. Hospitality. 
I should probably separate this into another post if I ever write about the whole trip in details. 

Family. Dad. Mom. Sister. Relatives. Finance. Education. Career. Stability. Settle down. Aging. Responsibilities.
