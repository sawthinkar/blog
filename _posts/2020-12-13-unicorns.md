*[17:26 Dec 13, 2020] Hpa-An*  

How can a country/a region empower SME's, statups, and unicorns? What policies should be made? UBC, environmental friendly businesses (eco tourism), production (agricultural + industiral), builders + makers + creators + producers + sellers + consumers + investors + scholars + educators + policy makers + stablizer, etc.
