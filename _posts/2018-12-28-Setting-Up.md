*[Dec 28, 2018] Yangon*   
Welcome to my very first post!  

So what did I just do? ·ÄÄ·Äª·Äî·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äò·Ä¨·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äô·Ä≠·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´·Äú·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∑·Åã

Here is a simple instruction on how to create a blog like this. (Just in case if I forget how I built this. lol.) 
* Go to <https://www.github.com> and register an account
* Create your first repository and name it yourname.github.io
  * It will create a [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) with above URL
  * Add an HTML file and make some changes
* Create another repository 
  * Name it **something**
  * Now go to repo Setting >> under Github Pages >> change Source to master branch
  * After a while, you can see the content in **something** repo at yourname.github.io/something
* In my case, what I did was, I just forked [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and renamed it to [blog](https://github.com/sawthinkar/blog). 
  * What is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)? Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator

note: make sure you don't have any folder with the name **something** under former repo; yourname.github.io 

## Images
### Profile Photo
* My profile photo is hosted on Amazon S3 with a size of 140 x 140 px. In the future, I might probably be hosting all my photos there. I will need to read more about it. 

### Quora icon
* The Quora icon next to the Youtube icon is not showing up, but you can ... (Nevermind, it appears now. Like after several minutes.)
  * I downloaded this [Quora logo](https://goo.gl/images/EeXytb) which is a png. 
  * I use this [converter](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svg) or [this](https://convertio.co/png-svg/) to convert it to SVG. 
  * Then in the SVG file, I changed width to 31.100000pt, height to 31.100000pt, and color to [#AA2200][1]. 
  * Change SVG to base64 [here](https://www.base64-image.de/).
  * You might want to read this [09: SVG with Data URIs][2]

## Notes
* In 2015, I guess, it was my first attempt to follow this [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to create something similar but failed. <http://hankquinlan.github.io/blog/>
