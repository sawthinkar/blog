title: Adding social account icons in the footer ðŸš¿

*[08:41 Dec 29, 2018] Yangon*  
Welcome to my second post!  
Today, I will be adding more social icons in the footer. 

### Social icons 
* Get the sites' logos in their press kit. 
  * Use this [converter](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-svg) or [this](https://convertio.co/png-svg/) or [this](https://www.pngtosvg.com/)(need a facebook account though) to convert it to SVG. 
  * Then in the SVG file, adjust width, height, and color. 
  * Change SVG to base64 [here](https://www.base64-image.de/). 
  * So there are three files in which you need to change. 
    1. _sass/_svg-icons.scss 
      * Put your base64 string here.
    2. _includes/svg-icons.html 
      * Add the function in Ruby and HTML
    3. _config.yml 
      * Enter your username of the social account here
      * [What is YAML or YML?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22268952/what-is-the-difference-between-yaml-vs-yml-extension) 
  * Now, restart the server if you are running the site in local (jekyll server). You should see the social icons below in the footer. ðŸ˜Ž

### Press kits and icons
* [Duolingo icon](https://www.duolingo.com/press)  
* [Goodreads icon](https://www.goodreads.com/about/press)  
* [Soundcloud icon](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:SoundCloud_-_Logo.svg)  
  * Click Originaldatei then View Page Source to get SVG codes
* [Shutterstock icon](https://twitter.com/shutterstock)
* Thinking about including my ElixirForum account, I came acroos this [SVG collection site](https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos).  After reading this [Github thread](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir-lang.github.com/issues/575), I feel like I might even probably have to remove some of the social icons I just added due to copyrights reasons.  
Anyway, I just made a different icon for ElixirForum account icon. 
* [StackExchange icon](https://stackoverflow.com/company/press)

### Notes

* SVG tricks shown by Ko Pyae Sone when back in Softhatch are pretty helpful here.
