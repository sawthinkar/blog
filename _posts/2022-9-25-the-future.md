• Informal value transfer system  
https://w.wiki/5sB3  
_"An informal value transfer system (IVTS) is any system, mechanism, or network of people that receives money for the purpose of making the funds or an equivalent value payable to a third party in another geographic location, whether or not in the same form."_  
- the host country and the receiving country have no diplomatic ties or the host country actively discourage the sending of money to the receiving country.
- the constant change in the world political environments, unsatisfiable payment systems, and/or a rapid continuously changing financial sector;
- a lack of easily accessible formal financial institutions in remote areas of some countries;
- transfers that are more efficient, reliable, and cheaper than formal financial institutions. (For example, a wire transfer of funds using banks involves fees charged to the sender and receiver, may take from two to seven days to complete, and may be delayed or lost. Funds moved through IVTS are usually available within 24 hours, with minimal or no fees charged to the participants);
- to avoid paying higher foreign exchange rates. (Funds sent through traditional transfers are converted to the currency of the recipient’s country; the fee charged for exchange rate conversion is set by the institution. IVTS operators, who speculate in currency exchange rates, charge lower fees);
- to avoid paying transfer taxes;
- to ensure anonymity since there may be minimal or no records maintained; or
- to avoid mandatory reporting of large transactions from financial institutions to governments.
