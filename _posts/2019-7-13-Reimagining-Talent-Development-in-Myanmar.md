Everytime, when I go to these events and hackathons, I am quite cruious to see and learn more about the culture, work environment and hierarchical structure of the big companies/corporates in Myanmar. Most of the time in the past I have just been working at early-stage startups, and I never thought about joining a corporates. I think I might probably give a try somewhere in the future or near future. There are also pieces written on how certain department/teams in Apple is run like a startup. I used to think like if you join a corporate you won't have much to do, since almost everything is settled, but there could also be challenging issues corporates are facing like talent shortage and employee training. How can those be tackled in the most efficient manner? The presentation of one of the speakers from YMOA's Learning and Development, Ko Sai, really blew my mind on how YOMA is giving training to their employees. I admit it was beyond my expectation. But then why not many other corporates seem to be doing that. What about for the government employees? 

Anyway, I get to go to work. Will continue writing later. (July 25, 7:51)
